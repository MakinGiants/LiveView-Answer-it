# LiveView Answer-it Plugin 

This is a plugin for the LiveView device
(a "smartwatch" for Android).

Sometimes you need to reject a call or you didn't know
that the call was rejected. Select a missed call and a 
message and send it without geting out of your pocket 
the phone.

You can predefine your messages.
